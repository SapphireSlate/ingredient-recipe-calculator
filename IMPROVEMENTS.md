npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/react-dom @types/node
```
2. Generate tsconfig.json:
```bash
npx tsc --init
```
3. Configure tsconfig.json with recommended settings

#### 2. Reorganize Project Structure
```
src/
├── features/
│   ├── recipes/
│   ├── ingredients/
│   ├── inventory/
